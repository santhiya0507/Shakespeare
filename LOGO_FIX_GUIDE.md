# 🎨 Logo Display Fix Guide

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The app now **gracefully handles missing logo images** by showing a beautiful text-based logo instead!

---

## 🎭 Current Behavior

### If Logo Image Exists:
- Shows the `shakespeare_logo.png` image
- Displays on all pages (home, login, register, dashboard)

### If Logo Image is Missing:
- Automatically shows a **text-based logo** instead
- Large 🎭 emoji with "Shakespeare Club" text
- No broken image icon
- Clean and professional appearance

---

## 📁 How to Add Your Logo (Optional)

### Step 1: Prepare Your Logo
- Format: PNG (recommended) or JPG
- Recommended size: 200x200 pixels or larger
- Transparent background works best

### Step 2: Save the Logo
1. Go to folder: `static/images/`
2. Save your logo as: **`shakespeare_logo.png`**
3. Exact filename required: `shakespeare_logo.png`

### Step 3: Refresh the Page
- The logo will automatically appear!
- No code changes needed
- Works on all pages instantly

---

## 🎯 Pages with Logo

✅ **Home Page** - Large logo at top
✅ **Login Page** - Medium logo with fallback
✅ **Register Page** - Medium logo with fallback
✅ **Dashboard** - Small logo in header
✅ **Admin Dashboard** - Small logo in header

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Fallback System:
```html
<img src="shakespeare_logo.png" 
     onerror="this.style.display='none'; 
              document.getElementById('textLogo').style.display='block';">

<div id="textLogo" style="display: none;">
    <h1>🎭</h1>
    <h3>Shakespeare Club</h3>
</div>
```

### How It Works:
1. Browser tries to load `shakespeare_logo.png`
2. If file exists → Shows the image
3. If file missing → Hides image, shows text logo
4. No broken image icon ever appears!

---

## 🎨 Current Text Logo Design

When no image is present, users see:

```
    🎭
Shakespeare Club
```

- Large theater mask emoji (🎭)
- "Shakespeare Club" text in brand color (#6366f1)
- Bold, professional typography
- Centered and visually appealing

---
