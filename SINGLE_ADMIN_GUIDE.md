# 🔐 Single Admin Account System

## ✅ System Overview

The BardSpeak app now has **ONE fixed admin account** that cannot be changed or duplicated.

---

## 👤 Admin Credentials (Fixed)

**Username:** `admin`  
**Password:** `admin123`

These credentials are **hardcoded** and the same for everyone using the app.

---

## 🚫 Admin Registration Blocked

### What Happens:

1. **Registration Page:**
   - If someone types "admin" as username
   - Fields disappear
   - Warning message appears: "Admin account already exists! Please use the Login Page"
   - Submit button is disabled
   - User is directed to login instead

2. **Backend Protection:**
   - Even if someone bypasses the frontend
   - Backend rejects admin registration
   - Redirects to login page with message

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### For Students:
```
Registration Page:
- Username: any name (except "admin")
- Register Number: required
- Department: required
→ Creates student account
→ Goes to Student Dashboard
```

### For Admin:
```
Login Page ONLY:
- Click "Admin Login" tab
- Username: admin
- Password: admin123
→ Goes to Admin Dashboard
```

**No admin registration allowed!**

---

## 📋 User Flows

1. Go to `/register`
2. Enter username (not "admin")
3. Enter register number

## 🛡️ Security Features

✅ **Fixed Credentials** - Username and password are constant

---

## 🗄️ Database Structure

### Admins Table:
```
id | username | password_hash
1  | admin    | [hashed_password]
```

**Only ONE row** - The admin account

### Users Table:
```
id | username | register_number | department | points | ...
1  | john     | 12345          | CSE        | 100    | ...
2  | mary     | 67890          | IT         | 150    | ...
...
```

**Multiple rows** - All students

---

## 🔧 Initial Setup

The admin account is created automatically when the database is initialized.

### Database Initialization (app.py):
```python
# Creates admin account with:
username = "admin"
password = "admin123" (hashed)
```

This happens automatically when you first run the app!

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Admin username is ALWAYS "admin"** (case-insensitive)
2. **Admin password is ALWAYS "admin123"**
3. **Cannot create new admin accounts**
4. **Cannot change admin credentials** (without code changes)
5. **All admins use the same login**
6. **Students cannot use "admin" as username**

---

## 🎯 Why This Design?

✅ **Simplicity** - One admin account for the whole system
✅ **No Confusion** - Everyone knows the admin credentials
✅ **Easy Management** - No need to track multiple admin accounts
✅ **Security** - Students cannot become admins
✅ **Consistency** - Same experience for all administrators
